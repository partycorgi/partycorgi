# Getting Started

## Welcome

Welcome to the Party Corgi Network Discord server!

The server is a inclusive home for technology-related creators to share in the practice of producing videos, courses, blog posts, and other material.

An **incomplete** list of who this might be:

* A Designer posting to an active Dribbble account
* Programmer who built their own blog site and is looking to post more
* A PM who participates on TikTok
* A QA engineer posting to their own YouTube channel
* An early-career person trying to grow their online presence on Twitter
* A senior level individual shipping a Podcast

Participation in the server is free and we have a [Code of Conduct](https://www.partycorgi.com/code-of-conduct) that must be followed. This Code of Conduct applies to your behavior inside and outside of the server.

## Channels in the Server

There are quite a few channels in the server and it may be overwhelming the first time you join. These channels are organized into categories.

* welcome
* voice-chat
* community
* progress
* creation
* technology
* cohorts-and-book-clubs
* community-operations
* gaming

## The Welcome Channels

In [#welcome](https://discord.gg/qvz3TRM), you can find a light introduction to the server and some bots to help you get set up, including a pronoun picker that will give you a role with your preferred pronouns that others can then use.

In [#news](https://discord.gg/HSuTMyr), you can find announcements. We don't use at-channel in the day-to-day operation of the server, so if you want to follow what's happening this is the channel to do it in. If you have your own discord server, this is an accouncements channel that you can follow as well.

## The voice-chat channels

> There are a few general voice-chat rooms that are available for any use. Often these rooms are used for screen-sharing and as a coworking space throughout the day. **You can join with or without a microphone** and they are numbered as voice-channel-01, etc.

#quiet-coworking is a coworking channel where everyone's mic is off. Use this if you're looking for some company but don't want to be interrupted.

#live-on-twitch is used when someone who is live-streaming wants to include the voice of others on their stream. **Do not join this channel unless you are ok with your voice being rebroadcast** to a live-streaming platform like Twitch or YouTube.

## The community channels

> Everyone needs a space that isn't "work". Here you can find channels for various interests and hobbies.

In [#baking-and-cooking](https://discord.gg/R3R32pE) you can find people baking and cooking. This is often as simple as "I threw cookies in the oven" or as complex as "I made a charcuterie board and dinner for guests".

In #corgos-and-frens you can find photos of people's pets as well as generally fuzzy and cute animal photos.

In #hardware-keyboards-and-setups you can find discussion of mechanical keyboards, cameras, computer parts, and other hardware.

In #listening-party you can post and find music. We have a bot that will pin active Spotify listening parties that you can join in on as well as an active group of people that post new and old music they found.

In #mobility-power-endurance you can find bike-riders, yoga, lifting, and more. Whether you're just finding a walking habit or you've been olympic lifting for years, this is a space to continue the practice of physical health.

In #plants there are many people keeping green alive.

In #anime-and-manga you can find discussion of recent releases or old classics.

## The progress channels

> Whatever you're working toward, these channels are made to share progress, find accountability for habits, and share wins.

* In #celebrating-wins you can find people sharing wins big and small: starting a company, solving a bug, or putting away your laundry.
* In #career-advice you can talk about different career moves you want to make. Finding a new job, changing paths, or starting out on your own.
* In #goals you can find public accountability for the goals you want to achieve. A single line or paragraph is fine, then you can post progress towards your goal in #practice-and-working-in-public.
* In #product-business you can find people building their own companies and infoproducts. If #career-advice is for employees than #product-business is for people shipping courses and SaaS products.
* In #practice-and-working-in-public you can share progress of any size. A single design, a squashed bug, or a future plan.
